## Hello.
# My name is Marissa
I am a Junior Data Analyst who love Calisthenic.



## About Me

ðŸŒŸ Data Enthusiast with a Dash of Humor and a Dose of Pharma Insight ðŸŒŸ

Hello there! I'm not your regular pharmacist who once filled your prescription; I'm the one who also envisioned how the pharmaceutical industry could benefit from innovative business strategies and effective marketing! Over the years, my career has taken me from ensuring the safe delivery of pharmacy services at hospital, to paving new business development pathways. My forte? Harnessing the power of data to drive results! ðŸ“ˆ

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:

- Spearheaded numerous successful omni-channel product launches, witnessing a whopping 65% expansion in the customer base.
- Became a data maestro, using Google Analytics and strategic scripts, escalating customer retention by 60%.
- Fused my pharmacy background with business acumen, resulting in partnerships with international medical device firms, driving a substantial 28% revenue boost in a single year.

As I venture into the world of data analytics, I'm keen to blend my pharmacy background and marketing expertise to bring unique insights to the table. Always ready for a good chuckle and a challenging data set!
