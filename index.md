## 🚀About me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Marissa, and I've transitioned from pharmacy to becoming an enthusiastic data analyst.   🚀

🤝 I'm currently on the lookout for opportunities to bring my analytical skills to a new role as a Data Analyst.

My career has taken an exciting turn. I moved from working in pharmacy marketing to the world of data analytics. I changed paths because I realized that analyzing data can uncover lots of interesting and important information. 💡

✨Alongside my analytics work, I also give back to the community by being part of the [Learning and Applied Research team at Okanagan College](https://www.okanagan.bc.ca/learning-and-applied-research). In this role, I use my data skills to help Okanagan breweries become more cost-effective on waste water management. 


Outside the world of tech, you can find me embracing the great outdoors. 🏃‍♂️ I love running and I'm proud to have completed a full marathon in Bangkok in 2020.

🚴Cycling and hiking are also my go-to activities. 🌲 And recently, I've taken up calisthenics to boost my energy levels and sharpen my focus and concentration. It's all about balance, right?

🌎Traveling is another passion of mine. It's a way to connect with different cultures, perspectives, and experiences - much like how we connect through code and technology. 

Let's stay connected! Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissa-jaikaew-1155911mar/)  ✨
